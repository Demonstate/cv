    <hr />
    <p><em>Computing is any goal-oriented activity requiring, benefiting from, or creating computing machinery. It includes the study and experimentation of algorithmic processes and development of both hardware and software. It has scientific, engineering, mathematical, technological and social aspects. Major computing disciplines include computer engineering, computer science, cybersecurity, data science, information systems, information technology and software engineering.</em></p>
    <h3>Definitions</h3>
    <p>
      <em>"In a general way, we can define computing to mean any goal-oriented activity requiring, benefiting from, or creating computers. Thus, computing includes designing and building hardware and software systems for a wide range of purposes; processing, structuring, and managing various kinds of information; doing scientific studies using computers; making computer systems behave intelligently; creating and using communications and entertainment films; finding and gathering information relevant to any particular purpose, and so on. The list is virtually endless, and the possibilities are vast."</em>
      </p>
    <p>
      <em>ACM also defines seven sub-disciplines of the computing field.</em>
      </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Computer engeneering.
        </li>
      <li>
        Computer science
        </li>
      <li>
        Cybersecurity
        </li>
      <li>
        Imformation systems
        </li>
      <li>
        Information technology
        </li>
      <li>
        Software engeneering
        </li>
    </ul>
<p>
  <em>However, Computing Curricula 2005[5] also recognizes that the meaning of "computing" depends on the context:</em>
  </p>
<p>
  <em>Computing also has other definitions that are more specific, based on the context in which the term is used. For example, an information systems specialist will view computing somewhat differently from a software engineer. Regardless of the context, doing computing well can be complicated and difficult. Because society needs people to do computing well, we must think of computing not only as a profession but also as a discipline.</em>
  </p>
<p>
  <em>The term "computing" has sometimes been narrowly defined, as in a 1989 ACM report on Computing as a Discipline:</em>
  </p>
<p>
  <em>The discipline of computing is the systematic study of algorithmic processes that describe and transform information: their theory, analysis, design, efficiency, implementation, and application. The fundamental question underlying all computing is "What can be (efficiently) automated?"</em>
  </p>
<p>
  <em>The term "computing" is also synonymous with counting and calculating. In earlier times, it was used in reference to the action performed by mechanical computing machines, and before that, to human computers.</em>

<h3>History</h3>
    <p>
      <em>A computer is a machine that manipulates data according to a set of instructions called a computer program. The program has an executable form that the computer can use directly to execute the instructions. The same program in its human-readable source code form, enables a programmer to study and develop a sequence of steps known as an algorithm. Because the instructions can be carried out in different types of computers, a single set of source instructions converts to machine instructions according to the CPU type.</em>
      </p>
    <p>
      <em>The execution process carries out the instructions in a computer program. Instructions express the computations performed by the computer. They trigger sequences of simple actions on the executing machine. Those actions produce effects according to the semantics of the instructions.</em>
